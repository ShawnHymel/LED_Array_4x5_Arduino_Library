 * @brief   Library for the Plex85 board
 * @author  Shawn Hymel
 * @date    March 3, 2019
 *
 * This library controls the 4x5 Charlieplex LED array. Note that Timer1 is used
 * in this library to control the LED refresh. You will not be able to use it
 * for other uses.
 *
 * This library is based entirely on the SparkFun LED Array 8x7 Arduino library:
 * https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_LED_Array_8x7_Arduino_Library
 *
 * The graphics algorithms are based on Jim Lindblom's Micro OLED library:
 * https://github.com/sparkfun/Micro_OLED_Breakout
 *
 * Relies on the Chaplex library written by Stefan GÃ¶tze. Download and install
 * Chaplex.zip from https://code.google.com/archive/p/yacll/downloads
